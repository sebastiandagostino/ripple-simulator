# Project ripple-simulator

This project is a fork of the Ripple Network Consensus Protocol [simulator](https://github.com/ripple/simulator).

The original codes simulates avalanche to consensus with a network of randomly-connected
nodes that sparsely, randomly trust each other.

This fork tides up the code in different files to make it easier and cleaner to read.
Besides that, the main motivation for this fork is to separate the network creation from the simulation run.

By allowing to run a parametrized network, this project will be useful to analyse how different network topologies impact the consensus process.

## Supported compilers

Due to the original project structure and the use of a JSON parsing library, the C++11 compilers supported are the following:

- GCC 4.9 - 7.1 (and possibly later)
- Clang 3.4 - 3.9 (and possibly later)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 / Build Tools 14.0.25123.0 (and possibly later)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 / Build Tools 15.1.548.43366 (and possibly later)

## Compiling

This is a plain Makefile project so in order to build everything just run

```
make
```

## Running

The make command produces to executable files. To do a simple JSON file generator, simply run:

```
./gen
```

This will produce the `network.json` file that is provided.

In order to run the simulation with the default `network.json` file, simply run:

```
./sim
```

To run the simulation with a custom file placed in the same folder the project is located, type:

```
./sim custom.json
```


## About the JSON file

The structure of the JSON file used for the simulation is the following:

```json
{
	"numNodes": 11,
	"unlThresh": 2,
	"nodes": [{
		"nodeId": 0,
		"vote": 1,
		"latency": 401,
		"uniqueNodeList": [4, 1, 3, 5, 2]
	}, {
		"nodeId": 1,
		"vote": -1,
		"latency": 74,
		"uniqueNodeList": [4, 0, 3, 5, 2]
	}, 
	...
	],
	"links": [{
		"from": 0,
		"to": 1,
		"latency": 228
	}, {
		"from": 1,
		"to": 9,
		"latency": 110
	},
	...
	]
}
```

The first attribute is **numNodes** which should be consistent with the **nodes** list attribute size. There is no consistency check.

The **unlThresh** attribute is the amount of nodes in the UNL to consider consensus. This should be change to a percentage value from 0 to 100 in the future.

Then there are two lists: **nodes** and **links**.

Each **node** in the list has a **nodeId** that has to go from **0** until **(numNodes - 1)**. The **vote** attribute has to be either **1** (loyal or consistent) or **-1** (faulty or dissident). Every **nodeId** in the **uniqueNodeList** must exist. The same goes for the **to** and **from** attributes for each **link**. The consistency checks have not been implemented yet.

Each node transmits the messages through the network using the links and they vote on transactions regarding the votes of trusted nodes in their UNL (unique node list).

In order to generate JSON files with more flexibility, another auxiliary project [graph-builder](https://github.com/sebastiandagostino/graph-builder) was created in Java.

## Notes from the original authors regarding the simulation run

1) 8 second worst-case convergence seems possible with sparse trust over a
realistic simulated Internet.

2) Supressing validations, other than over very slow links, seems to do more
harm than good. Every message not sent increases convergence time, resulting
in more messages overall. Supressing validations over slow links may make
some sense, since odds are the node will get the validation from a faster
path first anyway. (To some extent, this happens automatically, unless the
pipe is fat and slow.)
